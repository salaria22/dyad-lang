## Introduction

The Dyad Language Kernel serves as the foundation for modeling and simulation. It allows users to define complex systems in a clear and concise manner. Dyad's design philosophy emphasizes simplicity and effectiveness, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

## Features

- **Clear Syntax**: Dyad uses an intuitive syntax that simplifies the modeling process.
- **Flexible Framework**: Adaptable to various domains, including engineering, economics, and social sciences.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Access to a wide range of libraries that enhance modeling capabilities.
- **Community Support**: Join a growing community of users and contributors who share knowledge and resources.

## Installation

To get started with Dyad, you need to download the latest release. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/salaria22/dyad-lang/releases) section to find the appropriate version for your system. After downloading, execute the installation file according to your operating system's guidelines.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Download the Release**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/salaria22/dyad-lang/releases) section and choose the latest version.
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to your preferred directory.
3. **Run the Installer**: Execute the installation file. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Getting Started

After installation, it's time to create your first model. Dyad provides a simple command-line interface that allows you to interact with the kernel. 

### First Steps

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the Dyad installation directory.
3. Type `dyad` to launch the kernel.

You should see a welcome message along with the Dyad prompt, indicating that the kernel is ready for your commands.

## Usage

Dyad is designed for ease of use. Here are some basic commands to help you get started:

### Defining a Model

To define a model, use the following syntax:

```plaintext
model MyModel {
    // Define parameters
    parameter a = 5;
    parameter b = 10;

    // Define equations
    equation result = a + b;
}
```

### Running Simulations

To run a simulation, use the command:

```plaintext
run MyModel;
```

This command will execute the model and display the results in the console.

### Example Model

Here is a simple example of a model that simulates the growth of a population:

```plaintext
model PopulationGrowth {
    parameter growth_rate = 0.1;
    parameter initial_population = 100;

    equation population = initial_population * exp(growth_rate * time);
}
```

### Running the Example

To run the population growth model, type:

```plaintext
run PopulationGrowth;
```

This will calculate the population at various time intervals based on the defined growth rate.
